## 📧 US Email Template: The "India Consumer" Pitch

### Subject: Get Social Life — $250K Seed for India's Social Infrastructure

**Body:**

Hi [Investor Name],

I'm building Get Social Life, a personality-matching platform for the 300M+ young professionals in India's metros facing a loneliness crisis.

**The Product**: We use a 5-dimensional personality algorithm to match 5 strangers for curated dinners. It's "Hinge for real-world friendships."

**Why India?**
- 100M+ professionals aged 22-35 in top metros
- 15% YoY growth in urban migration
- Low operational cost: ₹2,500/dinner ($30) vs $150+ in US cities

**Traction**: Core algorithm built, MVP tested in Hyderabad (India's tech hub).

**Ask**: $250K–$500K for launch & scale to 3 cities (Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune).

Would love to discuss the India consumer social opportunity with you.

## 📧 US Email Template: The "Technical Founder" Pitch

### Subject: Technical Founder building Social AI for the Indian Market

**Body:**

Hi [Investor Name],

Most social apps in India are just copies of US apps. I'm building something built specifically for the Indian professional context using data-driven matching.

I've built Get Social Life — a platform that uses **cosine similarity across 5 personality dimensions** to curate real-world connections.

**Stack**: Node.js, Python (Flask/scikit-learn), MongoDB, AWS.
**Unit Economics**: $30 cost/dinner → $60–$100 revenue/table. 50%+ margins.

Raising $250K seed to dominate the Hyderabad market and expand.

Check out the code & logic: https://github.com/ramji3030/get-social-life

Thanks,  
Ramji
