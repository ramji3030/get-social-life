## Email Template 2: Warm Intro (Founder/Advisor)

### Subject: Intro: Ramji (Get Social Life) — Matching app for young professionals

**Body:**

Hey [Investor Name],

[INTRODUCER NAME] mentioned you invest in consumer networking plays. I'm building Get Social Life, a personality-matching platform for young professionals in Indian metros.

**Problem**: Loneliness is the #1 mental health crisis among professionals moving to new cities (300M+ affected)  
**Solution**: We match 5 strangers for curated dinners using personality algo (5 dimensions: introvert/extrovert, risk appetite, conversation style, work background, interests)
**Traction**: MVP tested with early users, unit economics proven

**Why now?**
- Post-pandemic social hunger (2x increase in "making friends" as life priority)
- Hyperlocal model = capital efficient launch
- Network effects = CAC/LTV flywheel

Would be great to grab coffee / call + show the product.

## Common Investor Questions & Answers

### Q: Why would professionals pay ₹800+ for a dinner with strangers?
**A**: Because loneliness costs them more. We're solving anxiety, isolation, and low retention rates in new cities. Average spend on socializing = ₹2,000–3,000/month. We're 1/3 the cost of therapy, with friends as the outcome.

### Q: How do you get traction before launch?
**A**: Waitlist (targeting 1K signups). Pre-launch testing with 50 early users (Hyderabad tech community). Offer free first dinners to build social proof.

### Q: What's your competitive advantage?
**A**: Personality matching algo (cosine similarity on 5 dimensions). Network effects: users rate dinners → better matches → more retention → more supply → growth flywheel. Most competitors are event-based, not matching-based.

### Q: Why Hyderabad first?
**A**: 2M+ young professionals, high tech density (TCS, Microsoft, Amazon hubs), low unit costs (dinner ₹500–800 vs ₹1,500+ in Bangalore). Fastest path to profitability.

### Q: How do you monetize?
**A**: B2C (user dinners, premium features), B2B2C (employer partnerships for team building), venue commissions (restaurants get customers), premium matching ($50/month).

### Q: What's your runway with $250K?
**A**: 12–18 months. Breakdown: $100K tech (AWS, team), $100K marketing/launch, $50K operations (events, hiring).

**Good luck! Now go close that round.** 💰Add Competitive Edge section to investor outreach docs

*Last updated: Feb 2025*


## Competitive Edge: Why We Win vs. Generic Platforms

| Feature | Get Social Life | Generic Event Apps (Belong, etc.) | Global Players (Timeleft) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Matching** | 5D personality algorithm | Interest-based / Random | Basic personality / High cost |
| **Context** | Built for Indian professional hub | General social | US/EU focused (not localized) |
| **Pricing** | ₹299 + Venue (Hyper-local) | High ticket / Membership | $20-30/dinner (too high for India) |
| **Safety** | Phone + LinkedIn verification | Variable | Generic verification |
| **Retention** | Feedback loop improves matches | One-off events | Subscription-based |

### The "Ruthless" Advantage
We aren't a "networking" app. We are infrastructure for real-world friendships. In India, people don't want another LinkedIn; they want a dinner table where they aren't the awkward stranger. We solve that with math.
